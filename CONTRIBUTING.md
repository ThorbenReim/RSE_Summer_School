We welcome contributions from everyone! If you're interested in improving our library, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use forks and pull/merge requests to contribute effectively.

Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to our GitHub repository.
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top-right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

Step 2: Clone Your Fork
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine with the following command: 

$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
   
(Make sure to replace `your-username` and `repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and the name of the repository.)

Step 3: Create a New Branch
1. Navigate into your cloned repository:
   
$ cd repo-name
   


2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   
$ git checkout -b your-feature-branch
(Replace `your-feature-branch` with a descriptive name for your branch.)

Step 4: Make Your Changes
1. Implement your changes, improvements, or bug fixes in your local copy of the repository. Make sure to follow our coding style and guidelines, which can typically be found in a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the repository.
2. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.

Step 5: Commit Your Changes
1. When you’re ready to submit your changes, stage them for commit:
   
$ git add .
   


2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   
$ git commit -m "Add a brief description of your changes"
   

Step 6: Push to Your Fork
1. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   
$ git push origin your-feature-branch
   


Step 7: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
2. You should see a notification about your recently pushed branch with a button to create a Pull Request. Click on it.
3. Fill out the Pull Request template, providing a description of the changes you made, and ensure you are merging into the correct branch of the original repository (usually `main` or `master`).
4. Submit the Pull Request.

Step 8: Engage in the Review Process
1. After submitting your Pull Request, be responsive to feedback from maintainers and reviewers.
2. If changes are requested, make them in your local branch, commit the updates, and push again. Your Pull Request will automatically update.

Final Note
